Some programming exercises.

This project contains code I write for programming exercise.

Since it is for saving leetcode solutions, the project is named 'leetcode'. But in fact, it mainly contains two parts:

## 1.leetcode
  Containing some simple leetcode solutions I write myself. Under **leetcode**/src/main/java/edu/postgraduate/leetcode
  
  
## 2.programExercise
  Containing code I write when learning java. Under **leetcode**/src/main/java/edu/postgraduate/programExercise
  

## 3.test
  For convenience, I write most of main codes, which can drive a program to run, using Junit 4. These code are under **leetcode**/src/test/java
